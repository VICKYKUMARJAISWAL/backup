"Documentation of MDD requirements","Dear All,

I have been seeing a lot of requirements for MDD without any kind of concrete documentation or place where it can be tracked. As of now, nearly all of it is verbal discussion.
All requirements for MDD - be it enhancements or maintenance or review comments need to be properly documented or at least be on mail - nothing on Bugzilla or verbal. This is with immediate effect.

I have directed the dev team not to entertain any request which is not via the correct channel with immediate effect.

Also, since I am owning the track, please mark me in all communications related to requirement and delivery.

"UIDAI Attendance Notification","Dear Team,

 

This is to bring to your attention that employees are not spending 9 hours
in office and many a times not marking biometric attendance either on entry
or exit.  Due to this, UIDAI may show us short attendance and we may land up
with billing loss (as of now UIDAI has not done this, but as per internal
information they may do so ).  So everyone needs to spend 9 hours in office
and your biometric should record 9 hours of office stay each day.  This is
also important from the delivery point of view and customer trust building.


 

In case the biometric device is not working,  please make sure you sign the
attendance register at the respective locations, which will be submitted as
proof of record in case of non availability of the biometric data.  In case
of  billing loss due to  employee's short attendance  or partial attendance,
deduction will be made  from the employee's next month's salary. This rule
will be applicable with immediate effect. Also, all employees should record
both in time and out time via the biometric devices. In case of only either
entry or exit attendance being marked, the employee will be treated as
absent.

Hi Pankaj,


Till now we have not committed our code, so let me confirm withh Shelendra regarding this and will intimate you.
Also when are verifying OTP using Match OTP Server(using mobile number), we need two values i.e., ""appId"", ""licenseKey"" which we need to configure in our property file.
I heard that we also need to create a separate ""appId"" for our application and map it with corresponding ""licenseKey"". (Need clarity on it) Am working on code changes for the above issue, as we cannot reuse the existing method.

Hi Tony,

The screenshots you have shared are for Splash, Home, Get UID(?), Download Aadhaar and Send OTP screen. Other two are I guess for Registration. Though the page title is missing in them. We need to review all screens (relating to the 9 service icons + About, FAQs and Important document pages). Are all the services are ready? Can we see the screens for Retrive UID/EAI, verify Aadhaar, Mobile and Email, Enrolment Search, Aadhaar Status as well?

I saw Aadhaar Update on the home menu. Is it going to be there too? If yes, please share the screens for the same.

Thanks & Regards,
Snigdha

Hi Snigdha,
                  We made most of the changes you have suggested. We need the icons for ""About us"" and ""documents"". Though this is not a blocker, we want to make this change before release itself.

Dear Jeetendra,

The screens looks ok. But I have a few suggestions which I have incorporated in the attached screenshots.

The App FAQs must be only about the services and should be generic. Answers should be such that doesn't get updated frequently.

For more detailed information the user should be sent to the website FAQs which is the single live repository that gets updated regularly.

For About page I am giving here some sample text. Please get appropriate content from the concerned authority.

Sample Text for About App: The Aadhaar App is a window in your mobile device for the resident of India to access various Aadhaar based services and information in a hassle free and quickest possible way. The self-service portal fulfills the Authority's vision of empowering ‘the residents of India with a unique identity and a digital platform to authenticate anytime'.

The bouquet of services hosted here is designed to provide fast, reliable and comprehensive information about their Aadhaar to the residents.

Hi  Pankaj,
                  We had discussion with Snigdha regarding the icons in footer. She came up with a suggestion that we will be keeping 3 icons which helps us in maintaining the same UI.


1. Icon can be changed to anything with gives information about usage of aadhaar  and can be referred from portal
2. About  icons should be mandatory and can be referred from portal
3. Faq icons should be mandatory  and can be referred from portal

Hi,
     We have a couple of doubts regarding the new UI of resident portal. There is HELP and SETTINGS icon which we have added in the footer of the dashboard screen option 1-1. As of now we don't have any feature  which specifies the use of these icons in the BRD or HLD,  but removal of these icons may spoil the UI. Can you provide us with alternate icons which suggests existing feature.

Thanks and Regards

"Circular on Benefits of Long Term retention of PF Accounts","

 

 

 

Dear HCLites,

Importance and Benefits of Long-Term retention of PF Accounts

The mail intends to inform you regarding the benefits of retaining the PF accounts for longer duration.

EPFO is a statutory body which maintains retirement fund . The retirement benefits are reciprocal to the length of contributory membership. The longer contributory service makes the subscriber/ employee eligible for the longer benefits, whereas early/premature withdrawal disables the benefits mentioned below:

1)    Loss of service membership for pensionary benefits, as minimum 10 years of continuous contributory membership is required to be eligible for pensionary benefits.

2)    Losing the opportunity of availing advances from the accumulation of self-membership fund which are available only on completion of 5 years or more contributory services.

3)    Deduction of TDS applicable if withdrawal is made before 5 years of contributory service.

4)    Withdrawal benefit is not available, if withdrawal is made through form 10-C for the service less than 6 months.

It is further recommended for employees who have resigned and are joining new organization to transfer  PF accumulation to new organization rather than withdrawing them.

Keeping in mind , benefits of long term retention of PF accounts , it is therefore advised to not make premature withdrawal and closure of PF account .

Dear All,

 

As discussed with PMs, going forward always please attach Quality team’s go ahead mailer on release documents while sending the documents to the testing team for further process.

 

This is done in view of some recent instances where the documents were send to the testing team without the Quality review & go ahead mailer.

 

Thereafter the testing team is requested to send the documents to the Quality team with the attach go ahead mailer to complete the process cycle.

 

Kindly start following the same with immediate effect.

 

PMs are requested to cascade the mail to the required associates.

 

Feel free to revert in case of any clarifications.

Dear Colleagues,


 


Digital technologies and evolving business models are fast changing the way
technology business is being done. Growth of ""as a services"" model,
convergence of enterprise & consumer technologies, machine learning,
automation/robotics & data monetization are some of the key trends defining
the tech buyers' agenda with a focus on developing relevant digital
capabilities at speed and scale.


 


Charles Darwin famously said, ""It is not the strongest of the species that
survives, not the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.""
HCL Infosystems is a practical testament of this theory. In its four decades
of existence, HCL Infosystems has seen many highs as well as lows with
changing market dynamics and opportunities. In our various business segments
we have witnessed many peers and competitors folding up. But HCLI has stayed
the course and has been able to successfully ride the waves because of our
demonstrated ability to transform over and over again.


 


REFINING OUR FOCUS


 


Financial year 2017-18 was an eventful year for the Company because we took
a number of strategic decisions with a view to consolidating our businesses.
The guiding principle has been to focus on market segments & businesses that
are high growth and profitable and scale down businesses that were not
financially meaningful or were unprofitable. The divestment of our Domestic
Services businesses including Care and the MEA business has been a part of
this strategy towards consolidation of the company.


 


Our Domestic Services business was largely comprised of offerings like
Multi-Vender Technical Support, Facility Management and End User Managed
Support which were essentially low margin engagements. Over the last three
years, we tried to build this business through investments in RIM, ITOC and
emerging technology offerings like IOT and Cloud. However the progress was
slow and limited and the business consistently incurred losses over this
period. Our customers and our employees were being under served by us.
Therefore, we divested the domestic services business to Karvy who are
expected to invest and grow this business in the future. This is a win for
us, a win for Karvy, and a win for our customers, partners and employees.
Some of our peer organizations like Wipro, HPE & IBM have been exploring
similar business models by divesting / outsourcing their low margin and
commoditized businesses.


 


HCL Care Services has been divested to Quess Corp. HCL Care business has
been amongst the leading after-sales services providers for product
categories such as mobile phones, consumer electronics and consumer durables
in the customer lifecycle management space. However it was a low revenue
business with low margins and not a fit in our future business strategy.


 


The divesting of HCLI MEA to Axis Investment has been made due to an
assessment of geo-political risk impacting the economy in the region. With
the downturn in oil prices, countries in MEA have been experiencing a
challenging economic environment and slow business growth for several
quarters.


 


Again with regards to HCL Learning, the education industry in general has
been encountering tough marketing conditions with major churn in business
models of multiple organizations. Moreover, the learning business moreover
was not synergistic with future strategic growth businesses of HCLI.


 


INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE


 


The recent set of strategic actions have been strong steps towards making
HCLI a fast growing, agile, profitable and strong free cash flow company -
strongly focused and positioned for future. This is the operational template
and paradigm of most successful organizations in the world today.


 


The focus going forward would be on growing our Enterprise Distribution,
Consumer Distribution, Singapore Services businesses and successfully
managing our Systems Integration business. We are confident about being on
the right path. While there is more work to do, we are already seeing that
our strategy is working. Overall HCLI Revenue grew in FY18 to over INR
4,000+ Cr (with over 7000 people) powered by strong performance in
Enterprise & Consumer Distribution businesses. The overall operational EBIT
became positive last year in third quarter (Q3'18). The plan is to drive at
least INR 5,000 Cr+ revenue in FY 2019 (with less than 2000 People) with a
highly engaged and productive workforce.


 


Consumer Distribution (CD) business has scaled up quickly in the last two
quarters and we're focussing on building on the momentum in that business.
This business has undergone a successful transition from a single-brand to a
multi-brand distribution model and lot of our growth came from distribution
of multi brand consumer technology products of Apple, Nokia, Samsung and
Microsoft.


 


We did over INR 1,500 Cr of revenue in this business and we are expecting
over 70% growth in the next financial year. We have identified a number of
additional key brand partnerships and emerging segments like Distribution as
a Service and Direct 2 Retail that would be the growth engines of the
business going forward.


 


Enterprise Distribution (ED) business has been a success story for us and
has grown significantly over the last three years. This is a profitable
business for us with positive EBIT. In FY 18 we made over INR 1,500 Crs. in
revenue, a 32% revenue growth. We are all set to build the next phase of
growth for the ED business. This is an exciting time for the business and we
are looking at addressing a number of high growth and margin opportunities
going forward like Cloud, Hybrid Infrastructure, Network, Device as a
Service and Security.


 


HCLI Singapore (SEA) business has been another success story for us. This
business has been growing steadily and is the most profitable business for
us. During FY 18 and now in FY 19 we have made investments close to S$5 mn
in creating a new command center and in automation tools etc.to fully gear
up for significant growth. We have built great trust, relationships and
equity in Singapore and will continue to keep a strong focus on building
this business.


 


In System Integration (SI), we are strongly focused on execution which is on
track. We have a wealth of experience in SI having delivered complex nation
building projects over the years. Many of the projects that we have
delivered across the sectors have been truly world class. There are lots of
synergies between the SI and ED business and we are working towards
leveraging the strong SI skills & capabilities in pursuing complex and high
value Enterprise business opportunities.


 


We have also signed a partnership agreement with Karvy where we would
jointly pursue large market opportunities. Karvy would leverage our strong
capabilities, credentials and experience in driving some of these high value
market opportunities along with key talent from our SI teams. While our SI
team would focus on complex solution design and architecting elements of the
opportunities, Karvy would drive the Managed Services and technical support.


 


HCLI is all geared to grow again, We have an incredible foundation to build
upon, and we will combine the best of today with new innovation and
investments to build the best future for HCL Infosystems, our partners and
our customers. We have recalibrated and moved into areas of greater value.
The entire vision is to build a highly productive organization where every
employee is strongly business aligned and contributing towards driving
greater business value. A business construct that most of the successful
organizations in the world have been gearing towards. I urge you all to
focus on the future journey and be part of a successful transformation.
Given how quickly we and our markets are moving, I am committed to sharing
openly and transparently what I am seeing and where we are going

I want to bid farewell to you all and inform you that I am leaving my position . Today is my last day at work.



I have enjoyed working for this company and I appreciate having had this wonderful opportunity to work with you all.



During these last 6 years, you all have provided me support and through your encouragement and guidance I have been able to excel at the projects offered to me.



With many of you, I have shared a unique camaraderie which I hope will continue in the years to come even though I shall not be here with the company.

"Re: Lost my headphone today (HCL Emp. 11012806)","
Dear Vicky, 

This is not the way to talk to clients or anybody. Issues like this are to be escalated to company admin copying HR. There is a process for everything. I could understand that you might have lost a very expensive headphone, but expressing it in this way is totally unacceptable. 

Going forward please don't mark such mails for this kind of issues directly to the client rather take help from our admin to get things sorted.

Hi Vaseem, 

I asked to each one individually. Everybody has replied same ""I did not take your Headphone"". The place where I am sitting is not covers by the cctv and one cctv is not more than enough for such a big ODC. I did not had such kind of experience .First time i saw this accident iniside the office premises. 
Today I lost Headphone may be next day Laptop. 

Anyhow Thanks for your effort and help.

"Digitally Signed Form 16 for FY 2017-18","
Dear HCLite,

Please find attached part A/Part B (as applicable) of your Form 16 for the
year ended 31st March, 2018 for the assessment year 2018-19.

As a part of our eco-friendly initiative, this year also we are sending
digitally signed Form 16.(Note: As per Income Tax Department Circular No. 2
Dated 21st May, 2007, our company is permitted to issue Form 16 which has
been signed with Digital Signature). However, No separate hardcopies of Form16 will be given.

Additionally, to assist you with filing of tax returns we have invited
TaxSpanner, the leading electronic tax advisory firm in India. TaxSpanner
brings you the fastest electronic tax filing solution, helping you to file
your return in minutes through their website www.taxspanner.com.


Important Note:

Your Form 16 document is password protected; the password will be your DOB
in ddmmyyyy format. For example, if DOB is 5-jan-1980, then the password
will be 05011980.

We recommend to use Adobe Acrobat 7 or above to view the document. The older
version of Acrobat Reader does not support the digital signature feature to
the fullest extent and may distort the signature. Therefore, You can
validate the digital signature in your Form 16 by following the steps
provided below. However it is not mandatory to validate signature as
digitally signed Form 16 is valid without validating signatures.

Please note the green tick mark will appear on the signature with Adobe
Acrobat Version 8 or below and with new version of Adobe Acrobat Version
(Version 9 or above), the green tick mark will appear on the signature panel
at the top.

You can validate the digital signature in your form 16 by following the
steps provided below:

1. Open the attached form 16, go to first page of the form 16, you will see
digital signature as validity unknown..

2. Keep the cursor on ""Validity unknown"" and right click and select
""Validate Signature"", then click on ""Signature Properties"".

3. Further click on the ""Show Certificate"", then click on ""Trust"", then
click on ""Add to Trusted Identities... "" and select ""Ok"".

4. Further select ""Ok"" and close all the windows, you will see digital
signature as ""Signature Valid"" with a tick mark.

Therefore, this is to inform you that HCL has decided to keep off tomorrow
10th September, 2018 for employees working only at UIDAI office (Hebbal,
Bangalore) as most of the government and private transport services are not
running tomorrow in lieu of Bharat Bandh. As per the guidelines, we will be
working on Saturday 15th September, 2018 as compensatory off. 

 

Only business critical people will be working tomorrow to support the
operations. Those will be informed by their respective Managers. 

 

Managers:Please disseminate this communication to all their respective
reportees and especially who have joined recently.
