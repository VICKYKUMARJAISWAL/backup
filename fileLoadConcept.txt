#some note about how to load a classpath for the simple java project and Maven project,Dynamic project.

1.If project is type of Maven or Dynamic and resources file is under of Folder which is made as resource then in this case we use url to load a path like given below
classpath:xml/csvreport.csv

in this case structre of file would be as

src/main/resources/xml/csvreport.csv

2.If project has folder which contains file in the level of src in this case we use following url

file:csv/cvsreport.csv
and structre would be 

csv/cvsreport.csv


Remarks:if folder is resource folder then we should use classpath and file in case of folder is not resource folder and it is in the level of src. 


#For simple project

1.If folder is resource then we should use system.getProperties("user.dir")+"add the path of file

e.g---system.getProperties("user.dir")+"/resource/file/file.properties

2.if folder is not resource then in this case we use 
directly like ./resource/file/file.properties
